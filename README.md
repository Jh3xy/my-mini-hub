# Mini Hub ⚡

A minimalist personal link hub — my own version of Linktree.  
Built with **HTML** and **CSS**, featuring a monochrome “paper and ink” style.

## 🧠 Concept
I wanted something clean, grounded, and personal — just black text, white background,  
subtle shadows, and *navajowhite* hover states for warmth.  
Think sketchbook meets digital portfolio.
